# Heyho, Evgenii is here!

I love solving interesting problems using software. As a lifelong learner I
constantly look for new challenges. While I prefer to deliver great,
maintainable, production quality code that is a charm to read for others and
future me, I'm also an entrepreneur at heart trying to find solutions that best
fit in the bigger picture.

My focus is on building great tech. I am happy to share my expertise with
colleagues as a Front End Developer and as Sr.QA Automation.

</div>

I probably missed all kind of important stuff but I hope you get the idea.
